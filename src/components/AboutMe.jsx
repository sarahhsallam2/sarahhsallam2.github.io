              Hi, I am <b>Sara Khaled</b>, a senior student in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at the German University in Cairo (GUC). 
              As a passionate software engineer and proactive problem solver, I am dedicated to continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and turning ideas into reality through coding, game design, and mentoring others.
              I specialize in <b>Web Development</b>, <b>Full Stack Architectures</b>, <b>Game Development</b>, and <b>VR/AR Solutions</b>, aiming to create immersive and user-friendly experiences. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey into tech started with a fascination for how things work. Over the years, I've improved my skills in languages like <b>Java</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>MEL</b>, <b>Prolog</b>, and frameworks such as <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>NestJS</b>.
                I have built full-stack apps with <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>MERN Stack</b>, and engineered microservices using <b>Spring Boot</b>, <b>Docker</b>, <b>Kubernetes</b>, <b>RabbitMQ</b>, and <b>Redis</b> while managing databases like <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>, and <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b>.  
                I also create immersive AR/VR experiences in <b>Unity</b> and tackle animation & 3D simulation with <b>Blender</b> and <b>Maya</b>. In my free time, Iâ€™m all about space adventures, game development, and exploring emerging tech. I believe in turning dreams into real solutions that make a difference! 
              </p>

              <p>
                Outside of software engineering, I explore emerging technologies, read about space exploration, and pursue outdoor adventures. I would welcome the opportunity to connect and build innovative, real-world solutions together.  Let's connect and collaborate on something impactful!
              </p>
